## Enzyme

---

### Why Enzyme?

- Readable
- Convenient

---

### Why <u>not</u> Enzyme?

Enzyme’s API encourages testing implementation details.

<Notes>
  Primarily shallow rendering. But also selection by component name and
  component instance state and property inspection.
</Notes>

---

### What is shallow rendering?

---

<Mermaid
  id="component-tree"
  content={`
graph TD
  Form-->FU(File Upload)
  Form-->I(Input)
  Form-->C(Checkbox)
  Form-->SB(Submit Button)
  FU-->N((Network Request))
`}
/>

---

<Mermaid
  id="shallow-component-tree"
  content={`
graph TD
  subgraph Shallow Render
    Form-->FU(File Upload)
    Form-->I(Input)
    Form-->C(Checkbox)
    Form-->SB(Submit Button)
  end
  FU-.->N((Network Request))
  style SB fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 2, 2
  style C fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 2, 2
  style I fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 2, 2
  style FU fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 2, 2
  style N fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 5, 5
`}
/>

<Notes>
  Allows ‘testing a component as a unit’, and ensures tests aren’t indirectly
  asserting on behavior of child components.
</Notes>

---

## Testing implementation details is a problem

---

<Mermaid
  id="shallow-component-tree-broken"
  content={`
graph TD
  subgraph Shallow Render
    Form-->FS(Fieldset)
    Form-->SB(Submit Button)
  end
  FS-.->FU(File Upload)
  FS-.->I(Input)
  FS-.->C(Checkbox)
  FU-.->N((Network Request))
  style FS fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 2, 2
  style SB fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 2, 2
  style C fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 5, 5
  style I fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 5, 5
  style FU fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 5, 5
  style N fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 5, 5
`}

<Notes>
  It limits your ability to refactor. If tests are constantly breaking for no
  good reason, you’ll stop testing.
</Notes>

---

Tests with shallow rendering are prone to break  
when components or component structure change,  
even if presentation and behaviour remains the same.

<Notes>Brittleness</Notes>

---

‘Does this mean we have to write integration tests and not unit tests?’

---

<Image size="contain" src="./assets/react-testing-library/test-pyramid.png" />

---

A unit test must run in isolation.

A unit test must focus on a small part of the system.

A unit test must be fast.

<Notes>
  The definitions of ‘unit test’ and ‘integration test’ are a bit wishy-washy,
  but a few things we can agree on.
</Notes>

---

#### An isolated unit does not mean...

- Test every single isolated function.
- Test every single isolated class.
- Test every single isolated component.

---

The _unit_ is whatever makes sense,  
tested at a level that makes sense.

---

#### In test-driven development...

- Tests are written before an implementation exists.
- It doesn’t matter how many subcomponents it takes to implement it.
- It doesn’t matter _which_ subcomponents implement it.

<Notes>A different way to look at it.</Notes>

---

As long as the interface does not change, when I refactor a module,  
<u>tests should not break</u>.

<Notes>
  Refactoring is one of the most important approaches to tackling tech debt. You
  don’t want to have your hands tied here.
</Notes>

---

Your unit tests based on shallow rendering are green...  
but the application is broken.

<Notes>
  <p>Tests are missing their purpose</p>
  <p>Changing potentially untested subcomponents.</p>
  <p>Third-party components break but tests never exercise them.</p>
</Notes>

---

‘But I don’t want to test third-party components!’

<Notes>This makes as much sense as mocking Lodash in tests.</Notes>

---

You still need to be sure the application works.

<Notes>
  <p>
    What’s the point of having all green unit tests if some untested component
    or integration breaks the application?
  </p>
  <p>
    Don’t fake or mock components unless you’re doing it to avoid a) shared
    state that breaks test isolation, b) slowness, c) setup complexity, or d)
    unpredictability.
  </p>
  <p>If it’s easier, faster and simpler to not mock, why not do it?</p>
</Notes>

---

#### Again, in test-driven development...

- Write a test to drive the implementation or integration.
- Do whatever makes the test pass.
- Again, it doesn’t matter _which_ components implement the feature.

---

Depends on JSDOM, otherwise test-runner–agnostic.

---

Provides a set of primitives that mimic user interaction.

---

### General queries

- `getByText()`
- `getByTitle()`
- `getByAltText()`
- `getByRole()`

<Notes>
  <p>Search by text or RegExp.</p>
  <p>No CSS selectors, you see what the user sees.</p>
  <p>Link or button? Doesn’t matter!</p>
</Notes>

---

### Form fields queries

- `getByLabelText()`
- `getByDisplayValue()`
- `getByPlaceholderText()`

---

### Escape hatch

- `getByTestId()`

<Notes>
  <p>Last resort if all else fails.</p>
  <p>Does not overload other IDs or classes for testing.</p>
</Notes>

---

`getBy*`  
finds first, fails test if not found.

`getAllBy*`  
finds all, fails test if not found.

---

`queryBy*`  
finds first, returns `null` if not found.

`queryAllBy*`  
finds all, returns `[]` if not found.

---

`findBy*`  
finds first asynchronously, rejects if not found.

`findAllBy*`  
finds all asynchronously, rejects if not found.

---

What you get back is DOM nodes.

<Notes>
  <p>No wrappers around React components.</p>
  <p>
    Rewrite with Vue and vue-testing-library and you’ll barely need to touch
    tests.
  </p>
</Notes>

---

### Firing events

```javascript
fireEvent.click(getByText('Click me!'))
```

---

### Examples

---

```javascript
test('simple', () => {
  const { getByLabelText } = render(
    <>
      <label htmlFor="test">Test</label>
      <input id="test" value="Initial" />
    </>
  )

  expect(getByLabelText('Test').value).toBe('Initial')
})
```

---

```javascript
test('user interaction', () => {
  const onSubmit = jest.fn()
  const { getByText } = render(<Profile onSubmit={onSubmit} />)

  fireEvent.click(getByText('Save'))

  expect(onSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
})
```

---

```javascript
test('wait for animation', () => {
  const data = testProfileData({ id: '9999' })
  const handleDelete = jest.fn()
  const { getByText, findByText } = render(
    <Profile data={data} onDelete={handleDelete} />
  )

  fireEvent.click(getByText(/Delete/i))
  fireEvent.click(await findByText(/Confirm/i))

  await wait(() => expect(handleDelete).toHaveBeenCalledWith('9999'))
})
```

---

```javascript
const Title = () => <FormattedMessage {...messages.title} />

function renderWithIntl(ui) {
  return render(<IntlProvider messages={messages}>{ui}</IntlProvider>)
}

test('i18n with custom renderer', () => {
  const { getByTestId, getByText } = renderWithIntl(<Title />)
  getByText(messages.title.defaultMessage)
})
```

---

### Cleanup

```json
{
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": [
    "react-testing-library/cleanup-after-each"
    // Other setup scripts...
  ]
}
```

---

Encourages not testing implementation details.

---

Encourages good accessibility practices.

<Notes>
  By not providing CSS node selectors, it encourages adoption of clear,
  unambiguous labels, titles and alt text.
</Notes>

---

Simple and lightweight.

---

## Challenges

---

### Combinatorial explosion

<Notes>Having to write many similar tests for all possible outputs.</Notes>

---

### Brittleness

<Notes>When one change breaks multiple tests.</Notes>

---

### Unhelpful feedback

<Notes>
  When a failing higher-level test doesn't tell you where the problem is.
</Notes>

---

### Setup complexity

---

#### @react-mock

- Component state
- XHR requests
- Fetch requests
- LocalStorage

---

```javascript
function renderWithState(ui, state) {
  return render(<StateMock state={state}>{ui}</StateMock>)
}

test('mock component state with @react-mock/state', async () => {
  const { getByText } = renderWithState(<Counter />, { count: 1000 })

  fireEvent.click(getByText('Increment'))
  await waitForElement(() => getByText(/clicked 1001 times/i))
})
```

---

#### It goes without saying\*

Mocking internal state representation  
counts as testing implementation details.

###### \* But I'm saying it anyway.

---

```javascript
function renderWithState(ui, state) {
  const store = createStore(reducer, state)
  return render(<Provider store={store}>{ui}</Provider>)
}

test('mock Redux state', () => {
  const { getByText } = renderWithState(<Counter />, { count: 1000 })

  fireEvent.click(getByText('Increment'))
  await waitForElement(() => getByText(/clicked 1001 times/i))
})
```

## I ❤️ react-testing-library

- Delightful API
- Discourages testing implementation details
- Encourages accessible components

But don’t let love blind you.

<Notes>
  <p>Not a silver bullet.</p>
  <p>Consider the tradeoffs.</p>
  <p>
    The further up the render tree you go, and the further up the pyramid you
    go, the more careful you’ll have to be to avoid duplication, brittleness,
    and ambiguity.
  </p>

That is all.
